# Girls Hike United - Supabase Backend Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes and improvements made to the Supabase backend integration for the Girls Hike United application.

## Background

The application was experiencing several critical issues with the Supabase backend:

1. **Authentication and Session Instability**
   - Users sometimes couldn't log in
   - Session state was inconsistent
   - Profile records were missing for some users

2. **Image Upload Failures**
   - Images uploads to Supabase Storage were unreliable
   - Permissions were incorrectly configured
   - URLs were not consistently saved in the database

3. **Post/Comment Creation Issues**
   - Creating new content was unreliable
   - The user association was sometimes lost
   - Schema inconsistencies between frontend and backend

## Fixed Components

### 1. Auth and Profiles Synchronization

- Added automatic profile creation trigger to ensure profiles are always created when users sign up
- Implemented orphaned profile recovery function
- Created diagnostic views to help troubleshoot auth/profile issues
- Improved session management with auto-refresh for expiring tokens

### 2. Storage and Image Uploads

- Configured storage bucket with proper public access
- Implemented row-level security policies for storage:
  - Users can only create/update/delete their own files
  - Everyone can view uploaded images
- Improved error handling and retry logic for uploads
- Added file path structure with user ID prefixing for better organization

### 3. Posts Schema and Permissions

- Aligned database schema with frontend expectations
- Added missing columns (`title`, `image_url`, `likes_count`, `comments_count`)
- Fixed RLS policies to ensure users can create and manage their own posts
- Added triggers to automatically update counts when liked or commented

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- Added indexes for faster querying of posts by user and creation date
- Added token cleanup to prevent token table bloat
- Implemented server-side validation function to confirm setup integrity

## Implementation Details

The fixes have been implemented in two main files:

1. `supabase/migrations/02_fix_auth_profiles_storage.sql`: Database-side fixes
2. `src/lib/supabase.ts`: Client-side improvements

## Verification and Monitoring

After applying these changes, you can verify everything is working correctly by:

1. Using the `check_user_setup` function to validate the entire configuration
2. Checking the diagnostic views (`user_account_status`, `storage_permissions_check`)
3. Testing the sign-up, image upload, and post creation flows

## Future Recommendations

For continued reliability, consider:

1. Setting up automatic database backups via Supabase
2. Implementing server-side image processing (resize, optimize) before storage
3. Adding rate limiting for sensitive operations
4. Setting up monitoring and alerting for database performance

## Summary of SQL Changes

The SQL migration includes:

- 2 new triggers for user/profile synchronization
- 4 new storage policies for proper image permissions
- 2 table alterations to add missing columns
- 2 index additions for performance
- 3 diagnostic views/functions for troubleshooting
- 2 count update triggers for posts/comments

## Client Improvements

The client-side improvements include:

- Retry logic for network failures
- Request timeouts to prevent hanging requests
- Token refresh logic for long-lived sessions
- Validation checking on startup

With these changes, the Supabase backend should now be reliable and production-ready.
